# Crypto-Clustering Challenge

In this challenge, I must use my knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

## The challenge is about finding the answers of the following:

1. Find the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame.
1. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data.
1. Optimize Clusters with Principal Component Analysis.
1. Find the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data.
1. Cluster Cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the PCA Data.

## Steps involved in completing the challenge:

1. I prepared the Data We used the StandardScaler() module from scikit-learn to normalize the data from the CSV file and we created a DataFrame with the scaled data and set the "coin\_id" index from the original DataFrame as the index for the new DataFrame. 
1. I found the Best Value for k Using the Original Scaled DataFrame and then we cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means Using the Original Scaled Data. 
1. After, I optimized the Clusters with Principal Component Analysis and found the Best Value for k Using the PCA Data
